My research will be focusing on an augmented guitar system developed by Enda Bates.

Overview:

    The augmented guitar is a normal guitar which uses sensors and software processing to modulate frequencies with the guitar as the initial sonic source. 


Technology:

    Data processed using Max MSP

    iPod touch used as 3-axis gyroscope and accelerometer for guitar:

        Interfaced using gyrOSC freeware and ad-hoc wireless network

    Phigits Spatial Board used as gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer for right hand:

        Magnetometer detects magnetic field around hum bucker pickups: acts as a reed switch

 Gestures:

    Right hand position controls spatial location of sound

        Downward strum: move sound from front -> left

        Upward strum: move sound from front -> right

    Magnetic field triggers low frequency drone

    Tilt guitar forward triggers secondary drone

        Tilt guitar left or right pans secondary drone left or right, respectively

    Hitting the body of the guitar causes sounds to swirl and triggers a tremolo effect


The only demonstration by Enda Bates:

Relation to my instrument:

    I plan on also making an augmented guitar. I will be incorporating an MPU6050 3 axis gyroscope and accelerometer to sense the position of the guitar.

    I want my instrument to focus on augmenting sounds bases on natural performance gestures and style of guitarists, and less on spatialization.

    Instead of focusing on right hand position, I will attach a pulse sensor to a guitar pick.

    I will also be using an fsr and soft potentiometer strips to sense location of the fretting hand, and pressure of open chords.
